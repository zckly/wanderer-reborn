## Installation and setup

Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage my Node.js versions.

You also need to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.

Run this in your terminal to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables. You can do that by running:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

After that, run:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

This will set up the database.

> In this template, we use `@acme` as a placeholder for package names. As a user, you might want to replace it with your own organization or project name. You can use find-and-replace to change all the instances of `@acme` to something like `@my-company` or `@project-name`.

## Quick Start

> **Note**
> The [db](./packages/db) package is preconfigured to use Supabase and is **edge-bound** with the [Vercel Postgres](https://github.com/vercel/storage/tree/main/packages/postgres) driver. If you're using something else, make the necessary modifications to the [schema](./packages/db/src/schema) as well as the [client](./packages/db/src/index.ts) and the [drizzle config](./packages/db/drizzle.config.ts). If you want to switch to non-edge database driver, remove `export const runtime = "edge";` [from all pages and api routes](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/issues/634#issuecomment-1730240214).
